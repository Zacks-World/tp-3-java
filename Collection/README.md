### Lists

This exercise involves managing a list of products. You will:

1. **Create a Product Class**: Define a class `Product` with the attributes:
   - `id` (long): the unique identifier for the product.
   - `name` (String): the product name.
   - `price` (double): the product price.
2. **Product Management App**: Create a main class `GestionProduitsApp` to manage products with an `ArrayList`.
   - Add products to the list.
   - Delete a product by index.
   - Display the list of products.
   - Modify a product by index.
   - Search for a product by name entered by the user.

### Maps

In this exercise, you will manage a map of student grades.

1. **Create a HashMap**: Use a `HashMap<String, Double>` where:
   - Key (`String`): student name.
   - Value (`Double`): student grade.
2. **Operations on the Map**:
   - Insert student grades.
   - Increase a student's grade.
   - Remove a student's grade.
   - Display the size of the map.
   - Calculate and display the average, maximum, and minimum grade.
   - Check if thereâ€™s a grade equal to 20.
   - After each operation, display the updated list using a `forEach` loop with lambda expressions.

### Sets

This exercise involves working with sets of student names.

1. **Create Two Sets**: Define two `HashSet<String>` objects, `groupeA` and `groupeB`, to represent two student groups.
2. **Set Operations**:
   - Add student names to each group.
   - Display the intersection of the two sets (common students).
   - Display the union of the two sets (all unique students from both groups).
